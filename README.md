**Obtainium for Ubuntu** — Update GitHub/GitLab/SourceForge projects straight through your package manager. No PPAs. No stale repos. No 8-year-old packages haunting your system.

Tired of Ubuntu's repos lagging years behind? Ubtainium watches GitHub and other repository releases and auto-updates them when a release is dropped. `.deb`, '.flat', `.AppImage`, binaries — all handled.
Can't find a .deb file? We got you! Tarballs (tgz/tar.gz) your only option? No problem. Ubtainium can even install from source. Every install gets a .deb file created and stored in a local repository. We 
also added a tool so that you can convert a project from source to a .deb file to share with the developers. (Tell them about us)


**Why ubtainium?**

Fresh Updates:    Devs ship weekly? You get 'em today — not in 2029.
Offline-Ready:    Cache installs and a Local Repository for air-gapped setups ( ISO vibes).
Zero Bloat:       No daemons, no telemetry, no dependencies.
